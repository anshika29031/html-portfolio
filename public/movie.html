<h3>Dear Zindigi</h3>
<p>This is the first movie which I saw which changed my view of phchitric treatments, Also its more related to my life. </p>

<h3>yeh jawaani hai deewani</h3>
<p>This movie for other people is about bunny but for me its more of Naina's life, how an ordinary girl fits to the current mordern thinking.</p>
